                    <p>As the trends and technology in web application development are escalating, the dominance of JavaScript framework continues to ascend further up. More and more developers worldwide have started to believe that JavaScript is one of the most efficient programming languages for building web applications.</p>
                    <p>One of the major reasons for this probable change is the JavaScript ecosystem, which has got richer and better. Frameworks are more adaptable for the designing of websites and hence, they are preferred by most of the website developers.</p>

                    <h3>1. <a href="https://angularjs.org/" target="=_blank">AngularJS</a></h3>
                    <br /> 
                    <p>There cannot be any second thoughts in mind about AngularJS being regarded as one of the dominant JavaScript frameworks for client-side development. This framework is operated by the Google and is basically implemented to use for developing Single Page Application (SPA). It extends the HTML into the application and interprets the attributes in order to perform data binding.</p>
                    <p>Top reasons to choose AngularJS
                        <ul>
                            <li>The Two-Way Data Binding</li>
                            <li>DOM Manipulation</li>
                            <li>A comprehensively featured framework with best tested defaults</li>
                            <li>Support of PWAs and built optimizer to improve integration of Material Design</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>

                    <h3>2. <a href="https://reactjs.org/" target="=_blank">ReactJS</a></h3>
                    <br /> 
                    <p>React JS developed by Facebook is one of the widest employed JavaScript libraries for building User Interfaces. It helps in the creation of interactive and reusable UI components. It makes the use of a virtual DOM and hence, the integration of the same with any application is easier. It also features JSX, which is an extension to the JavaScript language syntax. It helps in structuring the component rendering by using a familiar syntax. It simplifies the process of handling the DOM and API allowing applications to make changes in HTML and XML documents.</p>
                    <p>Top reasons to choose ReactJS
                        <ul>
                            <li>Virtual DOM offers better UX and improves performance</li>
                            <li>The components can be reused</li>
                            <li>Stable code due to one-direction flow of data</li>
                            <li>React fits well with any other framework as it is only view layer</li>
                            <li>Render React on the server side</li>
                        </ul>

                    <h3>3. <a href="https://vuejs.org/" target="=_blank">Vue.js</a></h3>
                    <br /> 
                    <p>Though developed in the year of 2016, this JavaScript framework has already made its way into the market and has proven its worth by offering multifarious features. Its dual integration mode is one of the most attractive features for the creation of high-end SPA or Single Page Application. It is a much reliable platform for developing cross-platform.</p>
                    <p>But when you have a much closer look at it, you would come to know that actually it is the blend of the features combining Angular and ReactJS. It was introduced in the market with this aim and concept only. If we talk about its similarity with the React JS, then Vue.js also asks the developers to store the component logic and layout besides the style-sheets in one file. Another likeness with React JS is the use of props and state objects. Now comparing its resemblance with Angular, Vue.js has mixed the HTML with JavaScript and the developer needs to make use of v-bind or v-if to run-into values from component logic to templates.<p>Having said that if you are not familiar with either AngularJS or ReactJS, you won’t be able to work with Vue.js and the choice of a probable framework would become very tricky. However, there is another good reason why Vue is gaining the spotlight. It is due to the presence of Redux library, which helps in developed complex and large-scaled application. In fact, this is one area where Vue excels over React as you have to devote a lot of time in making even the smaller changes. Vue is a good option to choose over Angular as well as the latter is a very difficult language due to its full-fledged framework with restrictive environment.</p>

                    <p>Ember.js was introduced to the software market in 2015 and since then, it has gained popularity with its wide application area. The features of Ember.js support two-way data binding and hence, establish a reliable platform for handling the complicated User Interfaces. Popular websites like LinkedIn, Netflix, Nordstrom and many more use the Ember.JS platform for their websites.</p>

                    <p>Backbone.js is a lightweight JavaScript library that is based on the Model–view–presenter (MVP) model and application design paradigm. It comprises of RESTful JSON interface that lets the developers to create and structure the front-end applications that can support and run on the web browser.</p>
                    <p>It abstracts the data into models, DOM into views and binds the two with the help of events. It can help in designing single-page web applications and synchronizes the different parts of web applications.</p><p>The backbone.js is more than useful front-end JavaScript library if you are looking to make your design more optimal while using less coding. It offers a well-organized and structured design to your application with better functionality. It is much easier to maintain your codes in Backbone.js as it interacts through events.</p>
