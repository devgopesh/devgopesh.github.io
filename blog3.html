                    <p>According to the Stack Overflow survey React grew in popularity by almost 150% from 2017 to 2018. This isn’t really surprising, and among other things is happening thanks to its growing component-based ecosystem. Some prefer libraries, others to develop their own components. Either way, here is the full list of some of the best UI component libraries and frameworks out there. Note that the list isn’t ranked, but brought as a useful resource.</p>                    
                    <br />
                    <h3>1. <a href="https://material-ui.com/" target="=_blank">Material-UI</a></h3>
                    <br /> 
                    <p>React components that implement Google’s Material Design. At over 45k Stars, it’s the most popular and widely used React UI library on GitHub. The benefit of using Material Design is that Google has done the UI and UX research, so individual developers don't have to. Therefore, customers benefit because they can learn the apps faster, due to consistent navigation and behavior.</p>
                    <p>Why to choose Materail_UI?
                        <ul>
                            <li>Ready access to Google’s UI/UX research</li>
                            <li>Stick to key metrics</li>
                            <li>Stick to layout that users expect</li>
                            <li>Focus on research, resource and testing</li>
                            <li>Simple and elegant solution to design challenges</li>
                        </ul>

                    <h3>2. <a href="https://react-bootstrap.github.io/" target="=_blank">React Bootstrap</a></h3>
                    <br /> 
                    <p>The most popular front-end framework rebuilt for React. At 15k stars, this library remains popular and useful even though we are still waiting for bootstrap 4 support.</p>
                    <p>React bootstrap replaces the Bootstrap javascript. Each component has been built from scratch as true React components, without uneeded dependencies like jQuery. As one of the oldest React libraries, react bootstrap has evolved and grown along-side React, making it an exellent choice as your UI foundation.
                    </p>
                    <p>Built with compatibility in mind, we embrace our bootstrap core and strive to be compatible with the world's largest UI ecosystem. By relying entirely on the Bootstrap stylesheet, React bootstrap, just works with the thousands of bootstrap themes you already love.</p>
                    <p>The React component model gives us more control over form and function of each component. Each component is implemented with accessibility in mind. The result is a set of accessible-by-default components, over what is possible from plain Bootstrap.</p>
                    <br />
                    <h3>3. <a href="https://reactstrap.github.io/" target="=_blank">Reactstrap</a></h3>
                    <br /> 
                    <p>This library provides simple React bootstrap 4 components. With over 7k stars and nearly 170 contributors, it’s a widely popular option for bootstrap fans. This library contains React Bootstrap 4 components that favor composition and control. The library does not depend on jQuery or Bootstrap javascript.</p>
                    <p>There are a few core concepts to understand in order to make the most out of this library.</p><p>1) Your content is expected to be composed via props.children rather than using named props to pass in Components.</p><p>2) Attributes in this library are used to pass in state, conveniently apply modifier classes, enable advanced functionality (like popperjs), or automatically include non-content based elements.</p>
                    <br />
                    <h3>4. <a href="https://semantic-ui.com/" target="=_blank">Semantic UI</a></h3>
                    <br /> 
                    <p>Semantic UI React is the official React integration for Semantic UI. With 45K stars it’s used by Netflix, Amazon and other great organizations. Semantic is a development framework that helps create beautiful, responsive layouts using human-friendly HTML.</p>
                    <p>Top reasons to choose Semantic UI
                        <ul>
                            <li>Semantic UI treats words and classes as exchangeable concepts. Classes use syntax from natural languages like noun/modifier relationships, word order, and plurality to link concepts intuitively.</li>
                            <li>Semantic uses simple phrases called behaviors that trigger functionality. Any arbitrary decision in a component is included as a setting that developers can modify.</li>
                            <li>Performance logging lets you track down bottlenecks without digging through stack traces.</li>                                
                        </ul>
                    </p>
